# Rust setup dev container

This is based on [Alfredodeza's repository](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-setup) of the same name.

## Dev container explanation

The dev container can be summarized in the image and VS Code extensions.

The image is self explanatory; it contains the image for a container with Rust preinstalled using Ubuntu as OS.

The extensions include the following:
- Rust Analyzer
- GitHub Copilot
- Dependi

## How to use the dev container

On Github, select Code > Codespaces and create a codespace on main.
